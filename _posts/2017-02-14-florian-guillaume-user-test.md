  One iteration of the User Test on the user Guillaume
---
**Author**: Florian W.

## Pre-Questions
Guillaume is a graduate student at IIT. He is also the Co-Founder of a Startup called [HubRoad](http://hubroad.io/). These two activities take the majority of his time.

He spend a lot of his free time _using his phone_ (approx. 40% of the time). Out of this time, 70% is for **web browsing** and the rest is  for **apps** usage.
Mainly, Guillaume uses _News App_ and his favorite app is _Google Maps_.

## Tasks
Following are the notes taken during the execution of the tasks #1 to #4 . Tasks #5 to #7 have not been done due to a shortage in time.

### #1
First, Guillaume launched the app. The ads are the first elements he saw, then he went and explored the ratings and the prices by using the _filters_ tab. Ability to see the distances to the actual location and the fares of the delivery.

> The first restaurants are the "sponsored" ones. The way they are displayed looks like "ads".

Then, Guillaume tried the menu on the left and explored the search button. He selected different cuisines and filters (ratings, prices, etc.).

After that, he stopped the exploration task.

### #2
Guillaume decided to go with "Sushi".

The process he went through is the following:
* Pressed the cuisine button
* Searched for _Japanese_ cuisines
* Used the filters to narrow the results (he added criteria on ratings & price range
* Selected the first one on the list “Ohama Sushi Cafe”
* Checked the amount of fees: "$3 is ok"
* Gave a look at the most popular meals. They had nice descriptions and some had also pictures
* Choose one of the sushi
* Placed the order

<br>

**F**: _Do you plan to use the reviews as part of your decision process?_

**G**: Check the ratings only, not the reviews when the food is known

### #3
He did the following steps:
* Went to the cuisine tabs
* Checked the name of the cuisines and look for one that he was unfamiliar with: "Dimsum"
> "Dimsum" is a type of Chinese restaurants

* Refined the criteria using filters
* Check the best ratings first. Additionally, he said that this kind of restaurant "_doesn’t seem to expensive_"
* Checked the reviews to know what type of dishes they proposed

Guillaume said that "_when you don’t know the meals, having all menu proposed is not useful; in fact, you only look at the most popular dishes_".

### #4
First, he tried to long-press the name of a dish → nothing happens.

Second, he tried to select the dish → redirected him to the "cart/purchase", but there is no mode details about the selected dish.

**F**: _Outside the app, how would you search info?_

**G**: Google / Search engines

**F**: _What features would you add?_

**G**:
- More precise descriptions and pictures for all the meals;
- Change the UI: use tabs for the different menus instead of lists.

### Debrief
According to Guilaume's feedback, the overall process (of the user test) is fine and easy to understand.
