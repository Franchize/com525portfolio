Tasks
#1
First launch, ads seen first, then checked the ratings, the prices (more expensive), distances to actual location, price of delivery
The first restaurant are “sponsored”
Tried the menu on the left
Tried the search button (select cuisines, filters)

#2
“Sushi” → cuisine button → “Japanese” → use the filters (ratings & price range) → first one on the list “Ohama Sushi Cafe” → $3 fees “ok” → select → check the more popular meals → nice descriptions + pictures → place order
Check the ratings only, not the reviews when the food is known

#3
To do so, went to the cuisine tabs → check the name of the cuisines and look for one that is unfamiliar → “Dimsum” → refine the criteria/filters → “It’s a type of Chinese restaurants” → check the good ratings first → “doesn’t seem to expensive” → check the reviews to know what type of dish it is → all menu are proposed, but when you don’t know the meals, you only look at the most popular ones

#4
Tried to long press the name of a dish → nothing happens
Tried to select the dish → redirect to the “cart/purchase”, no mode details about the dish

Outside the app, how would you search info? → Google / Search engines

What features would you add?
More precise descriptions + pictures for all the meals
Change the UI: use tabs for the different menus instead of lists

Debrief
